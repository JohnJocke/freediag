Freediag was originally written by Richard Almeida - he looked after the
package up to version 0.3a and provided sporadic CVS updates until August 2003.

Andy Whittaker did work in tidying up the code - and looked at making a
Windows version.

Bjorn Helgaas added logging and some other functionality.
 
Guilhem Valentin is believed to have written the dynamometer package (I'm not
certain of this).

                               --ooOoo--

As of March 2004, there has been a complete break between the original
developers and the present maintainers - so I cannot tell precisely who
contributed what before August 2003.  If you were a contributor and would
like to be credited here - please let me know.

Steve Baker is the current maintainer of the package.

Peter Dufault has undertaken a radical cleanup of the code and is responsible
for a large fraction of the present code-base.


                               --ooOoo--

Steve Baker.
