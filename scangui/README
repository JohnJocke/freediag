ScanGUI:  A Graphical front-end for freediag's Scantool.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application uses FLTK (Fast, Light ToolKit: www.fltk.org) to create
a basic graphical front-end for freediag's "scantool".

When you start scangui, it kicks off scantool as a separate process
and communicates with it using scantool's stdin/stdout.

Select the serial port you want to use from the list that scangui
presents you with - then click on the 'Connect to Car' button.  If
the yellow light in that button turns on within the next few seconds
then you have communication with the car.   If the light doesn't come
on then there is a problem which will require you to run scantool in
command-line mode to diagnose adequately.

Once you are connected to the car, you can use any of the widgets within
scangui to diagnose problems with your car.

When you are done, click on the 'EXIT' button and scangui will kill off
scantool and then exit.
