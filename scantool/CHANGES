Freediag Project Change Log: $Id: CHANGES,v 1.1.1.1 2004/06/05 01:56:38 sjbaker Exp $

---------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0

The freediag project had effectively 'died'.  No commits had been
made to the CVS repository in six months - no releases had been made
in almost a year and all of the forums and mailing lists were idle.

In resurrecting the project, it was necessary to take several 'personal'
versions that people had been working on (and been unable to contribute
back to the CVS respository) - and commit all of those changes in one
mighty change.

It's hard to list the differences between 0.3 and the first of these
'reborn' freediags - so I've chosen to start with a new (three part)
version number to indicate this radical rebirth.

The vast majority of changes are due to Peter Dufault - to whom much
is owed.

----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3

Changes 0.2->0.3 

1) Fix timing issue in idle code where idle responses arent always read
   on "smart" interfaces (me/br) and then confuse the application
2) Fix iso14230 code so that it works with message >127 bytes (bad typecast)
3) Fix BR-1 ISO9141 support
4) Support the "new BR-1 interface with ISO14230"
5) Support response from multiple ECUs in Scantool (lots of changes)
6) Make scantool read CVN instead of just how many messages to get CVN
7) ISO14230 now will use "user" supplied addresses on a per message basis
   - it will use the original connection addresses if 0 is supplied as a
   src/dest address to the send() routine and for all idle (tester present)
   messages
8) Start of elm device support [iso interface only]
9) Support ISO9141-2 cars which return keybyte 0x94 0x94, not just 0x08 0x08
10) Ensure set source address is used by scantool correctly
11) Added local mkdep for more portability
12) Removed some typecasts in defines used in case statements as this breaks
	latest versions of GCC



----------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2

Changes 0.1->0.2

Thanks to Bjorn Helgaas for much of this stuff ! And others for testing ...

1) Fix J1979 idle message format (affects ISO9141 cars)
2) Fix coredump on ISO9141 cars caused by uninitialised timer
3) Add basic J1850 support for smart interfaces such as Multiplex Engineering
4) Support for B. Roadman BR1 interface
5) diag_l1_open now checks layer 1 supported protocols against requested protocol
6) Fix a lot of the display of values in monitor mode
7) Add English display of units (configurable between English and Metric)
8) Fix many spelling errors in comments and printed messages
9) Extended data logging
10) Readline() support to give command line editing in the scantool
11) autoconf to make it build on Linuxs other then Redhat
12) diag_l1() bug where if you scanned, then changed interface type and scanned again, coredump
13) Fixed ISO14230 slow init to expect correct keybytes
14) Scantool handles h/w interface open failure nicely now
15) Get/Display Stored DTCs (mode 3) instead of just printing how many DTCs
16) Move O/S specific serial code into diag_os_linux.c from layer 0 drivers
17) Add $HOME/.scantoolrc startup command file support
18) Add ability to read in command files (source command)
19) Various other minor fixes
