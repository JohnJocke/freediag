FREEDIAG - Free diagnostic software for OBD-II equipped motor vehicles.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

LICENSING    : Freediag is licensed under the GNU General Public
               License (GPL) - details of which can be found in
               the file 'COPYING'.

AUTHORS      : A list of the various authors and contributors can
               be found in the file: 'AUTHORS'

INSTALLATION : Installation instructions can be found in the
                file 'INSTALLING'.

RUNNING      : To run the tool, you'll need an appropriate interface
               to connect the serial port on a laptop computer to the
               OBD-II port on your car.  With most available interfaces,
               it would be inadvisable to use a computer powered from
               wall socket because your car may not be adequately
               grounded.
 
               Run the program 'scantool' - which will need to be run
               as root on ISO vehicles, although it will work as normal
               users on J1850 vehicles.
