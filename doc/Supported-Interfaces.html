  <div class="section">Electrical Interface Types</div>

  <p>There are various common hardware interfaces used for diagnostic
  interfaces to vehicle electronic control units (ecus). Most manufacturers use
  one or two such interfaces for all systems on a vehicle. These include:

  <p><ul>
    <li>ISO9141
    <li>ISO14230
    <li>SAEJ1850-VPW
    <li>SAEJ1850-PWM
    <li>CAN
  </ul>

  <p>ISO9141 and ISO14230 are essentially compatible at an electrical level
  (with the exception that the latter will work on 24 volt vehicles).

  <p>The freediag protocol stack supports the above list with the exception of
  the CAN. The US OBDII standard and the European EOBD standard for
  communicating with emissions related ECUs do not mandate CAN support.
  
  <p>The ISO protocols are generally used by European Vehicles, and the two
  SAEJ1850 types by Ford and GM.
  
  <p>At a software level, ISO14230 is a vastly extended ISO9141-2 protocol that
  supports much longer data frames and much quicker communications startup with
  the ECU.
  
  <p>Further information can be obtained from:
  
  <p><ul>

  </ul>

  <div class="section">Freediag Supported Interfaces</div>

  <p>Freediag contains various drivers for different adapters that connect the
  PC serial port to a vehicle. Certain interfaces support more protocol types
  than have been implemented/tested within a driver, and some interfaces need
  to be ordered with special attributes (such as their address) to work without
  recompiling the freediag software library.

    <li>Andy Whittaker's OBD-II ISO9141 interface:<br>
    <a href="http://www.andywhittaker.com/ecu/obdii_hardware.htm">http://www.andywhittaker.com/ecu/obdii_hardware.htm</a>
    Freediag Driver: SE9141<br>
    <br>
    This is a generic serial to ISO9141 interface available in small
    quantities at a sensible price from Andy Whittaker in the UK.<br>
    <br>
    <li>Jeff's OBD-II ISO 9141 interface:<br>
    <a href="http://www.planetfall.com/~jeff/obdii">http://www.planetfall.com/~jeff/obdii</a>
    Freediag Driver: SE9141<br>
    <br>
    This site shows you how to build a generic serial to ISO9141 interface.<br>
    <br>
    <li>Silicon Engines ISO 9141 interface:<br>
    <a href="http://www.siliconengines-ltd.com/products/9141-232.html">http://www.siliconengines-ltd.com/products/9141-232.html</a><br>
    Freediag Driver: SE9141<br>
    <br>
    This is a commercially available generic serial to ISO9141 interface. It is
    supplied in a robust box with lots of lights. This interface was used to
    develop the first bits of the freediag project. It is functionally the same
    as the above two interfaces (with the exception of all the lights and the
    box).<br>
    <br>
    <li>B.Roadman ISO9141/VPW/PWM interface:<br>
    <a href="http://obddiagnostics.com/">http://obddiagnostics.com/</a><br>
    Freediag Driver: BR1<br>
    <br>
    Another commercially available interface, we haven’t yet tested the ISO9141
    side of the interface, and it does not support ISO14230. Future versions
    will support ISO14230 and we used this interface to develop the
    J1850-VPW/PWM support in Freediag. Thanks to B. Roadman for the donation of
    hardware to the project.<br>
    <br>
    <li>Multiplex Engineering VPW, PWM, and ISO 9141-2 interface:<br>
    <a href="http://www.multiplex-engineering.com/products.htm">http://www.multiplex-engineering.com/products.htm</a><br>
    Freediag Driver: MET16<br>
    <br>
    When ordering this interface you must order a T16 type interface.
    Multiplex Engineering produce two varieties of the T16 interface:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>T16-002: opto-isolated interface that requires power from the PC's
          serial port and uses a straight through male-female DB9 cable.
      
      <li>T16-003: Non-opto isolated interface, uses a null-modem female-female
          DB9 cable, doesn't require (much) power from the PC.
    </ul>
    <br>
    Many PC's do not provide enough power to drive the T16-002 interface and
    thus errors will occur (and "checksum error" messages will be printed by
    the freediag software). As the T16-003 has no opto-isolation there is a
    slight risk of damage to the PC. According to the manufacturer the risk is
    low and is negligible unless the vehicle is connected to a battery
    charger.<br>
    <br>
    When ordering an interface an interface that operates at 19200 baud and
    uses address 0x38 should be specified, or simple modifications to
    <i>diag_l0_me.c</i> and recompilation will be needed.<br>
    <br>
    The T16-002 interface was used to develop support for smart interfaces in
    freediag, it worked on a modern Sony Laptop but not on various branded PCs
    tested.
